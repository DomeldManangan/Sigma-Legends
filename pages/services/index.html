            </div>

            <div class="answers">
                <p>AI solutions are systems that use artificial intelligence to learn from data and make decisions, improving over time without explicit programming. They handle complex, dynamic tasks like image recognition or natural language processing. Traditional software, on the other hand, follows fixed rules, requires manual updates, and is best suited for structured, well-defined tasks. AI is more flexible, data-driven, and can adapt, while traditional software operates based on predefined instructions.</p>
